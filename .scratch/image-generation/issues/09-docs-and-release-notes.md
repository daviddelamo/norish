# 09 — Docs and release notes

Status: ready-for-agent
Blocked by: 06, 07, 08

Spec: `.scratch/image-generation/spec.md`

## What to build

The feature is documented where a self-hoster will look for it, and the target version's release notes say it shipped.

## Notes

`apps/docs` sits outside the pnpm workspace, so no CI gate reaches it. A green board says nothing about the docs site — build it locally before calling this done.

Docusaurus hard-fails on a missing screenshot path, so capture screenshots before referencing them. The E2E `ai` stack is the usual source.

Configuration here is database-backed, so there is likely no new environment variable. Confirm that rather than assuming; if one appears it needs `.env.example`, the configuration page and the Upgrade notes.

Follow `docs/agents/feature-docs.md`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] A documentation page covers configuring an image provider, the automatic switch, the manual action and the bulk sweep, with screenshots.
- [ ] The page states plainly that generating an image replaces the recipe's primary image, and that the replaced image is not recoverable.
- [ ] The target version's release notes describe the feature.
- [ ] Any new environment variable appears in `.env.example`, the configuration page and the Upgrade notes — or the absence of one is confirmed.
- [ ] The docs site builds locally and its link check passes.
