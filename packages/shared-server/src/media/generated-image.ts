/**
 * Store a Generated Image as a recipe's primary image (ADR-0025).
 *
 * The one operation the worker calls: the bytes are cover-cropped to exactly
 * 1280×720 and saved, the repository writes them into the primary slot in one
 * transaction — deleting the row that held it — and the displaced files are
 * removed afterwards. File removal is best-effort, as it is for a gallery
 * delete: a missing file must not fail a write that already committed.
 *
 * A displaced URL equal to the one just written is never deleted: storage is
 * content-hashed, so a re-run over identical bytes replaces its predecessor's
 * row while landing on the very same file.
 *
 * @returns the stored web URL of the Generated Image
