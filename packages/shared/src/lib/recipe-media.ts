/**
 * The image a recipe leads with — one definition, everywhere.
 *
 * The gallery (`recipe_images`) is the source of truth: the first image by
 * order is the primary, and the legacy `recipes.image` scalar is only a
 * fallback for rows that predate the gallery. Every reader that shows a
 * recipe's picture resolves through this (the media carousel, the dashboard
 * projections, the realtime echo patch, the Dish Colour), which is what lets
 * the scalar column be deprecated: it stays written in sync for
 * compatibility, but nothing depends on reading it where a gallery exists.
 *
 * The repository's SQL projections mirror this rule as a correlated
 * subquery (`PRIMARY_IMAGE_SQL` in the recipes repository); a change here
 * must move with it.

 * `order` stays loose because the zod contracts coerce it: callers hand this

 * where they are rather than demanding a parse first.
