/**
 * Ingredient Linking Worker
 *
 * One AI request infers, per step, which ingredient lines the step uses and
 * what fraction of each. The inference is semantic and runs once, against the
 * recipe's active measurement system; the repository write fans it out to
 * every system's rows by order. Ordinarily it is a gap-filler: only steps with
 * no Step Ingredients receive links, so a person's own links are never
 * replaced. An administrator's bulk refresh is the exception, and it clears
 * the recipe's links before writing. An empty claim is an unchanged success,
 * not a failure, and never clears anything. Uses lazy worker pattern.
 *
 * The worker holds no database handle and composes no queries: it calls one
 * repository operation, which is where the gap-filling write lives.
