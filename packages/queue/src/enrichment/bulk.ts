/**
 * Bulk Recipe Enrichment enrollment.
 *
 * One deliberate administrator action that sends every recipe on the server
 * through the same coordinator a newly created recipe goes through — with the
 * automatic origin on purpose, so the enabled automatic switches decide which
 * kinds run and a library-sized sweep never addresses its failures to whoever
 * clicked.
 *
 * By default Supplied Recipe Data keeps winning, so the sweep fills gaps
 * across the library without replacing anything a person or a source already
 * provided. `replaceExisting` is the administrator asking for the opposite:
 * every eligible kind reruns and overwrites what is stored. Categories,
 * Nutrition Information, Recipe Provenance and Step Ingredients are rewritten;
 * tags and allergy indications are appends and are unaffected either way,
 * because nothing records which of them AI wrote.
