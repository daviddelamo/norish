/**
 * Image Generation Worker
 *
 * Two AI requests, one job (ADR-0024): a structured call turns the stored
 * recipe into a short visual brief, and the image model draws from the brief.
 * The result is stored through the one replacement operation (ADR-0025) and
 * the Dish Colour is recomputed from the image just written, so the canonical
 * recipe update carries the new tint.
 * Uses lazy worker pattern - starts on-demand and pauses when idle.
 *
 * The worker holds no database handle and composes no queries: eligibility
 * was the coordinator's decision, and the storage operation is the only
 * write. The brief is never stored and never shown.
