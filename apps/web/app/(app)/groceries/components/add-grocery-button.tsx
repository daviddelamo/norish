/**
 * The phone's way into the add panel: the same pill the cook button and the
 * timer dock are, floating above the nav on the same offsets, so the three
 * cannot drift apart. It keeps its station over the nav and takes the nav's
 * own shrink rather than dropping to the floor, because a bar that hides by
 * shrinking in place never vacates the corner an escaping button would land in.
 *
 * Centred over the middle of the bar while it has the row to itself, and out
 * of the way at the left end once a timer is running — the dock owns the right
 * end, and two pills meeting in the middle is one pill covering the other. The
 * desktop header has its own add button, so this is mobile only.
