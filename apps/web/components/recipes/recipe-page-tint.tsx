/**
 * The one place a recipe page takes its hue from the dish (ADR-0023). The
 * scope carries two OKLCH channel variables and an attribute the CSS in
 * globals.css keys on to rebuild the background and surface tokens at the
 * theme's own lightness; the fixed underlay repaints the viewport in the
 * scoped background so the tint reaches the ground around a centred column,
 * not just the column itself.
 *
 * `display: contents` keeps this out of layout entirely: wrapping a page in
 * it moves no pixel of the untinted rendering.
 *
 * With nothing to tint with — no Dish Colour stored, or a reader who chose
 * theme colours (the caller passes null) — no attribute, no variables and
 * no underlay are emitted: the untinted page is the plain theme rendering
 * itself, not a tint at zero strength.
